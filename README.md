# Membership Analysis of A Downtown Toronto Gym
A look at the membership history of past and current clients from a boutique training studio in downtown Toronto from 2017 to 2020.  Using data collected from various sources (i.e., internal CSM, emails, and billing & scheduling software), I've performed an analysis of  membership survival as well as build predictive models on key membership milestones.  

**Key Factors**: 
    
   * Sociodemographic: age, employment sector
   * Membership history: membership type, monthly rates, attendance/cancellation rates 
   * Types of email interactions

**Notable Outcome Measure**:
    
   * Membership status at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months (via random forest and logistic regression)
   * Length of membership (via Cox-regression)
